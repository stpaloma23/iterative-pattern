# iterative-pattern
I wanted to create a iterative pattern with rectangles. I wanted the rectangles to get gradually smaller and change positin. I also wanted to position of the rectangles to be slightly askew. I also wanted to use a gradient to show the different rectangles. 
Initially I did not plan for it to looklike there are two different spirals going on, but i like the way it came out.
